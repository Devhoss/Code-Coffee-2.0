                <h5>Enjoy the moment</h5>
                <p>“After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one thing. So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear. She smiled – the kind of smile that makes me smile back –and she said, ‘When I’m seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment.’</p>

                    <p>A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep. The room was peaceful – almost silent. All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing. I stayed awake thinking about the time we’d spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible. And at some point, I realized that it didn’t matter what we’d done or where we’d gone. Nor did the future hold any significance.</p>
                    
                    <p>All that mattered was the serenity of the moment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just being with her and breathing with her.”</p> <hr>

            <h5>Laziness won’t get you anywhere</h5>
            <p>“In ancient times, a king had his men place a boulder on a roadway. He then hid in the bushes, and watched to see if anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers passed by and simply walked around it.</p>
            <p>Many people blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything about getting the stone removed.</p>
            <p>One day, a peasant came along carrying vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the way. After much pushing and straining, he finally managed.</p>
            <p>After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and note from the King explain that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the road.”</p><hr>

    <h5>Don’t say something you regret out of anger</h5>
    <p>“There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the boy lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.</p>
    <p>On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence.</p>
    <p>The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and the number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased. He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.</p>
    <p>Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.</p>
    <p>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.</p>
    <p>‘You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say I’m sorry, the wound is still there.'”</p> <hr>

        <h5>Be kind to others even if it hurts you</h5>
        <p>“In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.</p>
        <p>‘How much is an ice cream sundae?’</p>
            <p>’50 cents,’ replied the waitress.</p>
                <p>The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it.</p>
                <p>‘How much is a dish of plain ice cream?’ he inquired. Some people were now waiting for a table and the waitress was a bit impatient.</p>
                <p>’35 cents,’ she said brusquely.</p>
                <p>The little boy again counted the coins. ‘I’ll have the plain ice cream,’ he said.</p>
                <p>The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and departed.</p>
                <p>When the waitress came back, she began wiping down the table and then swallowed hard at what she saw.</p>
                <p>There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were 15 cents – her tip.”</p> <hr>
